**Title:** Recommender systems research under the EU’s Digital Services Act and AI Act

Keynote by [Vinagre João](https://algorithmic-transparency.ec.europa.eu/joao-vinagre_en), European Centre for Algorithmic Transparency.

## Abstract

The European Union has recently introduced several pieces of EU-wide legislation specifically designed for the digital economy. The two most relevant for the RecSys community are the Digital Services Act, in force since late 2022, that provides the legal basis for the activity of online platforms (most notably social media and marketplaces) and search engines in the EU, and the AI Act, that came into force in August 2024, that regulates high-risk AI systems, with specific rules for General Purpose AI systems. This talk will provide a technical angle to the two regulations, starting with the principles behind them, and focusing on their implications for the RecSys community, particularly from a research perspective.
