## Keynote #1
**Title:** On Human Preference Alignment for LLM-based Recommenders, by [Xiang Wang](https://xiangwang1223.github.io/)

<!-- [presentation slide](keynote.pdf) -->

### Abstract

Human-centric preference alignment has emerged as a frontier research direction in large language models, aiming to ensure that model outputs are aligned with human values and preferences. We apply preference alignment techniques to recommendation scenarios and propose the S-DPO framework, which effectively integrates preference alignment with recommendation-specific ranking objectives. The goal is to instill ranking information into the language model, enabling LLM-based recommenders to distinguish preferred items from negatives rather than focusing solely on positives. Moreover, we extend it with a self-improving mechanism.

## Keynote #2
**Title:** From Recommendations to Interactions: Putting Users Back in the Loop, by [Aixin Sun](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/axsun/)

<!-- [presentation slide](keynote.pdf) -->

### Abstract

Recommender Systems (RecSys) have garnered significant attention from both industry and academia over the past decades. Considerable effort has been devoted to developing algorithms that generate more accurate recommendations by learning user preferences from past user-item interactions. However, while these historical interactions are typically collected from online RecSys platforms, the user's role in the interaction process is often underexplored—particularly from the moment recommendations are presented to the point when user-item interactions are observed. In this talk, I will delve into the complexities of user-item interactions, including decision-making costs, multi-step engagements, and unobservable behaviors that can influence both model design and loss functions. Additionally, I will discuss the trade-offs between task specificity and model generalizability, emphasizing how well-defined task formulations provide the foundation for robust evaluation and effective solution development.
