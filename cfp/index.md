The 1st Workshop on Human-Centered Recommender Systems (HCRS) at [WWW 2025](https://www2025.thewebconf.org/) offers a unique platform to discuss and advance the development of recommender systems that prioritize human needs, values, and capabilities. We welcome research and position papers that explore ethical, social, technical, and user-oriented challenges in building responsible and human-centered recommender systems.

We encourage in-person participation, but remote presentation will be available for authors who cannot travel to Sydney.

## Topics of Interest

The HCRS workshop seeks to address diverse challenges in creating recommender systems that are not only effective but also ethical, trustworthy, and user-friendly. Topics include (but are not limited to):

- **Robustness**: Fraud detection, adversarial defenses, vulnerabilities of LLM-based recommender systems, user-aware robustness, and more.  
- **Privacy**: Differential privacy, federated learning, data ownership, privacy risks in LLM-based RS, unlearning, and related areas.  
- **Transparency**: Explainable and interpretable recommender systems, causal explanations, and transparency enhancements using LLMs.  
- **Fairness and Bias**: Addressing and debiasing algorithmic biases, fairness in LLM-based RS, and fairness evaluation frameworks.  
- **Diversity**: Content diversity, addressing filter bubbles and echo chambers, and balancing personalization with diverse recommendations.  
- **Ethics**: Ethical frameworks, user consent, responsible data usage, and mitigating misinformation in recommender systems.  
- **Accountability**: Traceability, responsible recommendations, and controllable or auditable algorithms.  
- **Human-Computer Interaction Design**: User-centric interfaces, conversational and interactive recommender systems, and accessibility.  
- **Evaluation and Auditing**: Innovative evaluation metrics, user satisfaction studies, auditing algorithms for biases, and governance frameworks.

We particularly welcome submissions connecting these topics to emerging technologies, such as large language models (LLMs), and their impact on recommender systems.

## Submission Guidelines

We invite submissions in two categories: **Position Papers** and **Research Papers**. Manuscripts will be reviewed by our program committee through a **single-blind review process**, meaning that authors' names do not need to be anonymized. Accepted submissions will be presented either as oral talks or posters during the workshop.

To encourage open discussions and early-stage research, **no official proceedings will be published**. However, all accepted papers are encouraged to be shared on [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) by the authors.

### Position Papers

Position papers aim to address one or more of the topics listed above or practical issues in designing human-centered recommender systems. Submissions can include conceptual frameworks, case studies, or industry insights. Manuscripts should not exceed **3 pages** in the ACM manuscript format (excluding references).

### Research Papers

Research papers present empirical or theoretical results related to human-centered recommender systems. Examples include studies on bias and fairness, explainability, privacy-preserving techniques, or user satisfaction. Manuscripts should not exceed **10 pages** in the ACM manuscript format (excluding references).

### Paper Format

All submissions must follow the ACM manuscript/sigconf format, with the following options:

```latex
\setcopyright{none}
```

CCS class and keywords sections are optional.

- **Position Papers**: Limited to 3 pages in the ACM manuscript format.  
- **Research Papers**: Limited to 10 pages in the ACM manuscript format.  
- Appendices are allowed but will not count toward the page limit. References and acknowledgements are excluded from the page count.

### Submission

Submissions must be made through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/account2/signin?l=1711152276907460930). Please specify the type of your submission: **Position Paper** or **Research Paper**.

## Important Dates

* **2024-12-18**: Paper submission deadline  
* **2025-01-13**: Author notification  
* **2025-02-02**: Camera-ready submission  
* **2025-04-28â€“05-02**: Workshop (half-day session)
